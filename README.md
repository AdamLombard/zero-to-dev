# Zero-to-Dev
While working to level up my skills as a developer I keep running across great, entirely free, learn-at-your-own-pace resources that are either:
- A) a little too advanced for where I am currently, or... 
- B) something I wish I'd discovered months ago.

So, I'm collecting my favorites here, and laying out each topic in a rough order from beginner to expert. There's a lot of overlap between resources, but that's intentional--I learn best by taking deeper and deeper iterative dives into a topic.

The ultimate goal is to point a total neophyte to any category below and say, "Just start at the top."

Suggestions welcome! :)
